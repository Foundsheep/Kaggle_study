# Kaggle_study
----
This repo contains Kaggle jupyter notebook I transcribed. There are some notes and code exploration in the middle of the notebooks alongside the original codes I followed, and primary purposes of these efforts are understanding how people are doing EDA in practice and their algorithmatic code traditions.
